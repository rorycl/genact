Thank you, this is helpful.

Do you have any comments about the use of `ConverseOptions` below, which
is defined in App, from cli where the cli command calls the interface
method app.Converse?

I ask because it feels like a dependency on App, even though of course
all these funcs and structs are in the same namespace.

```go
		Action: func(ctx context.Context, c *cli.Command) error {
			return app.Converse(
				ctx,
				ConverseOptions{
					c.String("conversation"),
					c.Args().First(), // prompt file
					c.String("settings"),
					c.String("history"),
					c.String("thinking"),
					c.Bool("new"),
					c.Bool("old-history"),
					c.StringSlice("attach"),
				},
			)
		},
```
