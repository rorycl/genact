This is helpful.

Please refrain from the third person narrative (`Okay, so I'm looking at
this `ConverseOptions` struct, and the user's concern about the CLI
"depending" on the App layer...`). Please confirm this point and discuss
matters directly with me, and also be fairly terse (if friendly) in your
responses.

Nevertheless the architecture explanation was helpful, and made sense.

Given the project layout below (this is a dirty repo where I have
been running the `genact` tool!), would you suggest moving
{api,app,history,structs,settings}.go to an `app/` directory, to make
this architecture more explicit?
